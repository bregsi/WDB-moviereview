Positive Feedback

    Modular and Understandable Code: The code is well-structured with concise functions, making it easy to comprehend. Each function serves a specific purpose, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
    Data Integrity Checks: The scraper performs data integrity checks by comparing the new data with the previously saved file. It updates the file only if there are differences, ensuring data accuracy.

Areas for Improvement

    Function Decomposition: Although the code is modular, there is room for further decomposition. Breaking down the main() function into separate functions would enhance code structure and improve maintainability.
    Increased Code Comments: Adding more comments would benefit users who are less familiar with the specific functions used. Clear explanations of their usage and necessity would improve code understanding.
